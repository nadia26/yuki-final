	<h2 class="description">What Is Cilantro?</h2>
	<div>
		<p>Cilantro, also known as coriander, is an annula herb in the family Apiaceae. Cilantro is native to regions such as southern Europe, northern Africa, and Southwestern Asia. All parts of the plant are edible, but the fresh leaves and dried seeds are most commonly used in cooking. Cilantro has been a part of human cuisine for a long time. Dried traces of cilantro were found in a cave in Israel that dated to around 6,000 BC. Remnants have also been found in ancient Egype, showing that its use was widespread even in ancient civilizations. The Chinese have used cilantro for centuries. As to how the plant reached the East from the West, we can only conjecture that it followed ancient trade routes. The spice routs between Asia and Europe were famous for taking spice from Asia to the Middle East and Europe. Aparently, this is a case of the reverse occuring. The herb was one of the first (along with dandelions) to be brought to the Americas from Europe. Cilantro was grown in many places, including the Massachusettes Bay Colony by the mid-1600s. It was brought into Mexico by the conquistadors in the 1500s. Now, cilantro is used in a variety of cuisine, and it also serves as a great addition to our nutrition value.
